# Builder Design Pattern

**Category:** Creational
**Intent:** Simplify the creation of complex immutable objects by separating construction from representation.
**Use cases:** Classes with many parameters (some optional), configuration objects, constructing immutable aggregates.

## Coder Army Reference Example

From [Lecture 28 — simpleBuilder/HttpRequest.java](https://github.com/adityatandon15/Low-Level-Design-Course/tree/main/Lecture%2028/Java%20Code)

**Theme:** Building an HTTP request with optional parameters using fluent builder.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class HttpRequest {
    private String url;
    private String method;
    private Map<String, String> headers;
    private Map<String, String> queryParams;
    private String body;
    private int timeout;

    private HttpRequest() {
        headers = new HashMap<>();
        queryParams = new HashMap<>();
        body = "";
    }

    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Executing " + method + " request to " + url);
        if (!queryParams.isEmpty()) queryParams.forEach((k,v) -> System.out.println("  " + k + "=" + v));
        headers.forEach((k,v) -> System.out.println("  " + k + ": " + v));
        if (body != null && !body.isEmpty()) System.out.println("Body: " + body);
        System.out.println("Timeout: " + timeout + "s");
    }

    // Nested Builder class
    public static class HttpRequestBuilder {
        private HttpRequest req;

        public HttpRequestBuilder() { req = new HttpRequest(); }

        public HttpRequestBuilder withUrl(String u)            { req.url = u; return this; }
        public HttpRequestBuilder withMethod(String method)    { req.method = method; return this; }
        public HttpRequestBuilder withHeader(String k, String v) { req.headers.put(k, v); return this; }
        public HttpRequestBuilder withQueryParams(String k, String v) { req.queryParams.put(k, v); return this; }
        public HttpRequestBuilder withBody(String body)        { req.body = body; return this; }
        public HttpRequestBuilder withTimeout(int timeout)     { req.timeout = timeout; return this; }

        public HttpRequest build() {
            if (req.url == null || req.url.isEmpty())
                throw new RuntimeException("URL cannot be empty");
            return req;
        }
    }
}

// Usage — fluent method chaining
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HttpRequest request = new HttpRequest.HttpRequestBuilder()
            .withUrl("https://api.example.com/users")
            .withMethod("POST")
            .withHeader("Authorization", "Bearer token123")
            .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .withQueryParams("page", "1")
            .withBody("{\"name\":\"Alice\"}")
            .withTimeout(30)
            .build();

        request.execute();
    }
}
```

**Key structural points:**
- `HttpRequest` constructor is `private` — can only be created via builder
- Builder is a **nested static class** — can access private fields
- Each `withXxx()` returns `this` (the builder) for **method chaining**
- `build()` validates and returns the final immutable object

## The Problem: Telescoping Constructors

When a class has many fields (8-10+), constructors become unreadable.

### BAD: Telescoping Constructors

```java
public class Order {
    private final String customerId;
    private final int priority;
    private final boolean giftWrap;
    private final boolean expressDelivery;

    // Which boolean is which? Caller has no idea.
    public Order(String customerId, int priority,
                 boolean giftWrap, boolean expressDelivery) {
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.priority = priority;
        this.giftWrap = giftWrap;
        this.expressDelivery = expressDelivery;
    }
}

// Usage -- confusing: what does true, false mean here?
Order order = new Order("C101", 2, true, false);
```

**Problems:**
- **Unreadable:** `true, false` -- which is giftWrap, which is expressDelivery?
- **Rigid:** Adding a new field means changing every constructor call
- **Error-prone:** Easy to swap boolean arguments and the compiler won't catch it

### BAD: Multiple Overloaded Constructors

```java
public Order(String customerId) { ... }
public Order(String customerId, int priority) { ... }
public Order(String customerId, int priority, boolean giftWrap) { ... }
public Order(String customerId, int priority, boolean giftWrap, boolean express) { ... }
```

This "telescoping" pattern gets worse with every new field. 10 fields = 10+ constructors.

---

## The Solution: Builder Pattern

### GOOD: Builder with Fluent API

```java
public class Order {
    private final String customerId;
    private final int priority;
    private final boolean giftWrap;
    private final boolean expressDelivery;

    private Order(Builder b) {
        this.customerId = b.customerId;
        this.priority = b.priority;
        this.giftWrap = b.giftWrap;
        this.expressDelivery = b.expressDelivery;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String customerId;
        private int priority = 1;            // default
        private boolean giftWrap = false;     // default
        private boolean expressDelivery = false; // default

        public Builder customerId(String id) {
            this.customerId = id; return this;
        }
        public Builder priority(int p) {
            this.priority = p; return this;
        }
        public Builder giftWrap(boolean g) {
            this.giftWrap = g; return this;
        }
        public Builder expressDelivery(boolean e) {
            this.expressDelivery = e; return this;
        }

        public Order build() {
            if (customerId == null)
                throw new IllegalStateException("customerId required");
            return new Order(this);
        }
    }
}
```

**Usage -- crystal clear:**
```java
Order order = new Order.Builder()
    .customerId("C101")
    .priority(2)
    .giftWrap(true)
    .build();
```

**Why this is better:**
- Every field is **named** at the call site -- no ambiguity
- Optional fields have **defaults** -- set only what you need
- The object is **immutable** (all fields are `final`)
- **Validation** happens in `build()` before the object exists

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Enforcing Required Fields

**Option A: Validate in `build()`**
```java
public Order build() {
    if (customerId == null)
        throw new IllegalStateException("customerId required");
    return new Order(this);
}
```

**Option B: Require in Builder's constructor**
```java
public static class Builder {
    private final String customerId; // required

    public Builder(String customerId) {
        this.customerId = Objects.requireNonNull(customerId);
    }
    // ... optional setters
}

// Usage
Order order = new Order.Builder("C101")  // must provide customerId
    .priority(2)
    .build();
```

**Exam Tip:** Option B is stronger -- the compiler forces the required field. Option A gives a runtime error. Mention BOTH in a viva.

### 2. Immutability

- The outer class constructor is **`private`** -- nobody can bypass the Builder
- All fields are **`final`** -- set once, never changed
- Collections should use **defensive copies**: `List.copyOf(b.rules)`

### 3. Fluent API

Each setter returns `this` (the Builder itself), enabling method chaining:
```java
.customerId("C101").priority(2).giftWrap(true).build();
```

## Complex Example: GameConfig with Collections

```java
import java.util.*;

public final class GameConfig {
    private final String name;
    private final List<String> rules;

    private GameConfig(Builder b) {
        this.name = b.name;
        this.rules = List.copyOf(b.rules); // defensive copy -- immutable
    }

    public String name() { return name; }
    public List<String> rules() { return rules; }

    public static class Builder {
        private String name;
        private List<String> rules = new ArrayList<>();

        public Builder name(String n) { this.name = n; return this; }
        public Builder addRule(String r) { this.rules.add(r); return this; }
        public Builder addAllRules(List<String> rs) {
            this.rules.addAll(rs); return this;
        }

        public GameConfig build() {
            if (name == null)
                throw new IllegalStateException("Name required");
            return new GameConfig(this);
        }
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```java
GameConfig config = new GameConfig.Builder()
    .name("Battle Royale")
    .addRule("No cheating")
    .addRule("Time limit: 10 min")
    .build();
```

**Key points:**
- `List.copyOf()` makes a **defensive copy** -- the caller can't modify the internal list after build
- `addRule()` accumulates items step by step
- The built `GameConfig` is fully immutable

## Practical Considerations

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **When to use** | Classes with 4+ fields, especially if some are optional |
| **Defaults** | Set sensible defaults in the Builder fields |
| **Validation** | Always validate in `build()`, not in setters |
| **Copy-builder** | A `toBuilder()` method lets you create a modified copy |
| **Lombok** | `@Builder` auto-generates builders, but may hide validation logic |
| **Thread safety** | Builders are NOT thread-safe by default. Don't share a Builder across threads |

---

## SOLID Connection

| Principle | How Builder Relates |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **SRP** | Outer class holds data. Builder handles construction. Separate responsibilities |
| **OCP** | New optional fields can be added to the Builder without breaking existing callers (they just don't call the new setter) |
| **DIP** | Client depends on the Builder API, not on constructor internals |

---

## Big Picture

- Builder is a **Creational** pattern focused on **step-by-step construction**
- Often used with **immutable classes** (all fields `final`, no setters)
- Contrast with **Factory**: Factory decides WHICH class to create; Builder decides HOW to configure a single class
- Contrast with **Prototype**: Prototype copies an existing object; Builder constructs from scratch

---

## Exam Tips (Quick Recall)

1. Builder solves the **telescoping constructor** problem
2. Each setter returns `this` for **fluent chaining**
3. Outer class constructor is **private** -- forces use of Builder
4. Validate required fields in **`build()`** or Builder constructor
5. Use **`List.copyOf()`** for defensive copies of collections
6. Builder creates **immutable** objects (all fields `final`)
7. Builder is NOT thread-safe -- don't share across threads

---

## Viva Questions

**Q1: What problem does the Builder pattern solve?**
It solves the telescoping constructor problem -- when a class has many parameters (some optional), constructors become unreadable and error-prone. Builder lets you set fields by name, step by step, with defaults for optional fields.

**Q2: How can required fields be enforced in a Builder?**
Two ways: (1) Require them in the Builder's constructor: `new Builder(requiredField)`. (2) Validate in `build()` and throw an exception if missing. Option 1 is compile-time safe; option 2 is runtime.

**Q3: Why is Builder often used with immutable objects?**
Because immutable objects need all fields set at construction time (no setters). Builder accumulates the values step by step, then creates the fully-initialized immutable object in one shot via `build()`.

**Q4: Compare Builder with telescoping constructors.**
Telescoping constructors: unreadable (what does `true, false, 3` mean?), rigid (adding a field changes all call sites), error-prone (swapped arguments). Builder: named fields, optional defaults, validation, readable call sites.

**Q5: What is a fluent API and how does Builder use it?**
A fluent API returns `this` from setter methods so calls can be chained: `.name("x").priority(2).build()`. Builder uses this to allow step-by-step construction in a single readable expression.

**Q6: Why is the outer class constructor private in the Builder pattern?**
To force all construction through the Builder. This ensures validation always runs and prevents someone from bypassing the Builder and creating an invalid object directly.

**Q7: What is a defensive copy and why is it important in Builder?**
A defensive copy (e.g., `List.copyOf(b.rules)`) creates an independent copy of a collection. Without it, the caller could modify the internal list after building, breaking immutability.

**Q8: Can you reuse a Builder to create multiple objects?**
Yes, but be careful. If the Builder has mutable state (like a list), the second `build()` will include state from the first. Best practice: either document this or create a new Builder each time.

**Q9: How is Builder different from Factory?**
Factory decides WHICH class to instantiate (returns different subtypes). Builder decides HOW to configure a single class (step-by-step construction with optional fields). Factory varies the product type; Builder varies the product configuration.

**Q10: What is `toBuilder()` and when would you use it?**
A method on the built object that returns a pre-filled Builder, allowing you to create a modified copy: `config.toBuilder().name("NewName").build()`. Useful when you want a slightly different version of an existing immutable object.

## Coding Exam Questions

### Problem 1: Spot the Builder Violations

```java
public class HttpRequest {
    public String method;
    public String url;
    public String body;

    public static class Builder {
        public String method;
        public String url;
        public String body;

        public void method(String m) { this.method = m; }
        public void url(String u) { this.url = u; }
        public void body(String b) { this.body = b; }

        public HttpRequest build() {
            HttpRequest r = new HttpRequest();
            r.method = method;
            r.url = url;
            r.body = body;
            return r;
        }
    }
}
```

**Task:** Identify all violations of proper Builder pattern and fix them.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

**Issues:**
1. Outer class fields are `public` and not `final` -- object is mutable
2. Outer class has default (public) constructor -- can bypass Builder
3. Setter methods return `void` -- no fluent chaining
4. No validation in `build()` (method and url should be required)
5. Builder fields are `public` -- should be `private`

**Fixed:**
```java
public final class HttpRequest {
    private final String method;
    private final String url;
    private final String body;

    private HttpRequest(Builder b) {
        this.method = b.method;
        this.url = b.url;
        this.body = b.body;
    }

    public String method() { return method; }
    public String url() { return url; }
    public String body() { return body; }

    public static class Builder {
        private String method;
        private String url;
        private String body;

        public Builder method(String m) { this.method = m; return this; }
        public Builder url(String u) { this.url = u; return this; }
        public Builder body(String b) { this.body = b; return this; }

        public HttpRequest build() {
            if (method == null) throw new IllegalStateException("method required");
            if (url == null) throw new IllegalStateException("url required");
            return new HttpRequest(this);
        }
    }
}
```

### Problem 2: Builder with Nested Immutable Object

Design a `Pizza` class using Builder pattern with:
- Required: `size` (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE)
- Optional: `cheese` (boolean, default false), `pepperoni` (boolean, default false), `toppings` (List<String>, can add one by one)
- The built Pizza must be immutable

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
import java.util.*;

public final class Pizza {
    public enum Size { SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }

    private final Size size;
    private final boolean cheese;
    private final boolean pepperoni;
    private final List<String> toppings;

    private Pizza(Builder b) {
        this.size = b.size;
        this.cheese = b.cheese;
        this.pepperoni = b.pepperoni;
        this.toppings = List.copyOf(b.toppings); // defensive copy
    }

    public Size size() { return size; }
    public boolean cheese() { return cheese; }
    public boolean pepperoni() { return pepperoni; }
    public List<String> toppings() { return toppings; } // already unmodifiable

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return size + " pizza" +
               (cheese ? " +cheese" : "") +
               (pepperoni ? " +pepperoni" : "") +
               (toppings.isEmpty() ? "" : " +toppings=" + toppings);
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private final Size size;           // required
        private boolean cheese = false;
        private boolean pepperoni = false;
        private List<String> toppings = new ArrayList<>();

        public Builder(Size size) {
            this.size = Objects.requireNonNull(size);
        }

        public Builder cheese(boolean c) { this.cheese = c; return this; }
        public Builder pepperoni(boolean p) { this.pepperoni = p; return this; }
        public Builder addTopping(String t) { this.toppings.add(t); return this; }

        public Pizza build() {
            return new Pizza(this);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Pizza p = new Pizza.Builder(Size.LARGE)
            .cheese(true)
            .addTopping("olives")
            .addTopping("mushrooms")
            .build();

        System.out.println(p);
        // LARGE pizza +cheese +toppings=[olives, mushrooms]
    }
}
```

### Problem 3: Builder with `toBuilder()` Support

Extend the `Order` class to support a `toBuilder()` method that creates a pre-filled Builder from an existing Order. Demonstrate creating a modified copy.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

```java
import java.util.Objects;

public final class Order {
    private final String customerId;
    private final int priority;
    private final boolean giftWrap;
    private final boolean expressDelivery;

    private Order(Builder b) {
        this.customerId = b.customerId;
        this.priority = b.priority;
        this.giftWrap = b.giftWrap;
        this.expressDelivery = b.expressDelivery;
    }

    public String customerId() { return customerId; }
    public int priority() { return priority; }
    public boolean giftWrap() { return giftWrap; }
    public boolean expressDelivery() { return expressDelivery; }

    // toBuilder: returns a pre-filled builder
    public Builder toBuilder() {
        return new Builder()

**Key insight:** `toBuilder()` enables creating modified copies of immutable objects without exposing setters. The original stays unchanged.
